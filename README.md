# MapRVA

We are a group of mapping enthusiasts in Richmond, Virginia who work to create and share geospatial data of our city using [OpenStreetMap](https://www.openstreetmap.org).
Here on GitHub, we collaborate on coding projects to support our mapping efforts.

## Get in touch

We welcome anyone to join us!
- Feel free to join our channel, `#local-rva` on the [OpenStreetMap US Slack](https://openstreetmap.us/get-involved/slack/)
